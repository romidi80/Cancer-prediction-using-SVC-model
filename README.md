# Cancer-prediction-using-SVC-model
Cancer prediction using SVC and comparing the result with Decision tree classifier and Logistic regression.

Welcome to the Ensemble Learning project, where we explore the power of combining multiple classifiers through a Voting Ensemble. In this project, we have employed Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Classifier (SVC) as base classifiers. The final ensemble reveals that SVC achieved the highest accuracy, reaching an impressive 74%. 

Ensemble Learning is a powerful technique that combines multiple machine learning models to enhance predictive performance. In this project, we explore how different base classifiers, namely Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Classifier (SVC), contribute to the overall ensemble's accuracy.

### Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is a widely used classification algorithm that models the probability of a binary outcome.

### Decision Trees
Decision Trees are a versatile tool for both classification and regression tasks. They partition the feature space into regions, making them effective classifiers.

### Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
Support Vector Classifier (SVC) is a classification algorithm that identifies the optimal hyperplane that best separates different classes.

## Conclusion
In this ensemble learning project, we explored the effectiveness of combining Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and SVC classifiers. The results demonstrated that SVC, as a base classifier, outperformed the others, achieving an accuracy of 74%. Ensemble Learning, with its ability to leverage the strengths of multiple models, proved to be a powerful approach for improving classification accuracy.
